# FEniCSx-vs-NGSolve
Test problems run both with FEniCSx and NGSolve. Used to better choose which library will be more convenient in the future.

The files for NGSolve have been uploaded as .ipynb files in order to have the possibility of looking at the plots of the solutions both with webgui, i.e., directly on the notebook, and with external softwares, e.g. ParaView.
